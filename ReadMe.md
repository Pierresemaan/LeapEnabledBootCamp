This repository, I take the unity 3D standard tutorial (The Boot Camp) and I modify it to be Leap Enabled
The motivation behind Leap Enabling Boot Camp was to answer some key questions:
•  Can it be done?
Answer: YES
•  How hard is it to Leap Enable a FPS or a 3rd Person Shooter?
Answer: Relative Simple
•  How easy is it to navigate?
Answer: Depends on your perspective.  The modifications I suggest below will allow you to experiment as well as simply use what I came up with.  I tried some different combinations such as using a single hand to control movement, mouse look as well as shooting.   This worked well in open space, but was not as usable in close quarter. Issues were mainly with unexpected “strafing” when you are trying to change the mouse look only.
•  Single Hand, or Hand and Keyboard for Navigation?
Answer: Again, the answer is most likely affected by desired gameplay and preference.  I ended up having 4 variables, one for strafing (leap or not) one for forward and backward (leap or not), another for shooting and yet another for mouse look.
My personal preference was to strafe using keyboard and use mouse look for hand, as well as forwards and backwards (after all, it is easy to use the z axis for that, closer or further from the screen).  Shooting, I loved using my hand for. 
•  Easiest way to “shoot” while navigating?
Answer: Tried initially a rotation of the hand from horizontal to vertical to indicate shooting, but that affected the accuracy of the positioning, an undesirable side effect.  I then simply using the act of splaying your fingers slightly – shooting if 4 or more fingers are detected, and that worked quite well.  
•  Key thing (included in steps below) is to allow shooting via traditional controls as well as Leap, so you can easily switch between themselves
•  Finally, I found it very useful to create a HUD to visualize what the Leap is doing Navigation wise, so I could see if I needed to tweak anything.  

Not sure where I will take this...
